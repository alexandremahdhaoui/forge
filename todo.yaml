  - Allow specifying prepend cmd to custom engines ?

    Artifact management is a bit random currently
    Forge should pass a tmp directory located in ./tmp/tmp-<SOMETHING> to engines and runners such that they create their non-build artifacts to this repo. Build artifacts must be built into ./build e.g. ./build/bin for binaries. For special build like code generation they write to files in this repo, they need to know about the abspath of the root of this repo. All in all we need to pass 3 directories/path: 1. tmp dir (abspath to a tmp dir inside ./tmp/) 2. build dir (abspath to ./build itself) 3. root dir (abspath to this directory)

    go-gen-mocks should track the state of the mocks. It should track that if any interface was added/removed it is removed from the output directory.
    Currently we just delete all mocks all the time but that's quite inefficient and error prone. Especially when code doesn't compile and the whole mock generation is broken because of build erros.

    Implement bpf2go code generation based on:
    ```make
    BPF_GOPACKAGE := bpfadapter
    BPF_DIR       := $(ROOT)/internal/adapter/bpf
    BPF_FILE      := $(BPF_DIR)/$(PROJECT)_kern.c
    BPF2GO_OPTS   := --go-package $(BPF_GOPACKAGE) -tags linux --output-dir $(BPF_DIR) --output-stem zz_generated
    ```
