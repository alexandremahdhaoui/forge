TODOs:
  - |-
    # forge global .envrc

    - Add a field to forge.yaml to specify a .envrc file that is sourced into forge.
    - Not sure if actually can source that file from the go program because obviously
      `exec.Command("source", ".envrc").Run()` will only source it in the spawned process.
    - The idea would rather be to parse the file, execute any stuff in "``", "$()" or "<()", etc...
      and "export"/set the environment variables.

  - |-
    # testenv-lcr

    - [ ] Fix TLS (use nodeport or ClusterIP to allow the node to communicate with the registry)
    - [ ] Implement concurrency for testenv-lcr: i.e. using different ports (not always port :5000)
